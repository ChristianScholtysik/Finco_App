The app is organized into several key components, each responsible for a different part of the user experience:

- **Components**: Reusable UI components built with React that form the building blocks of the app.
- **Pages**: Each major feature (like the Home, Transactions, Report, and Profile page) is a separate page within the app, making navigation straightforward.
- **Routing**: The app uses React Router to manage navigation between different pages.
- **State Management**: The app's state is managed with React's built-in hooks, ensuring that data flows smoothly between components.
